A platform which help people to find emergency shelters.

## Inspiration
<ul>
<li>
There is a fear of losing  our loved one, our jobs, and fear of losing businesses. Our economy is going through serious problems right now. In just six weeks more than 30 million people filed for unemployment. 
</li>
<li>Unfortunately, many people are sacred that they will never be able to recover economic impacts they have already had. 
</li>
<li>So, as students in technology,we build a platform to help people with their emergency shelter needs.</li>
</ul>

## What it does
It is a platform that let’s people know if there are any vacant rooms in hotels, inns, or motels near them for free. likeHome also aids people experiencing homelessness to find an extremely secure and safe environment to stay for short periods of time.  
<ul>
<li>
User can put in their location to find the closed room available to them.
</li>
<ul>Login:
<li>
This website is made specifically to ensure that everyone will be able to easily reserve a room, even if they don’t have much experience using technology. 
</li>
<li>
People are only required to login when they are ready to reserve a room. If someone doesn’t have a smart device, there is also an option to create a temporary login for someone else.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Book a room: Booking a room is easy. First they will click on reserve a room, it will take them directly to the login page. After logging in they just have to scroll down and click on “book your room” and it's done. Now they have a safe place to stay. 
</li>
<li>
Notification: In case if their selected hotel gets full, then it will send you a notification. And if there are any cancellation or availabilities it alerts them using this notification button. 
</li>
<ul>Ratings:
<li>After each stay people will be able to rate their stay by a positive rating or a negative rating. All positive ratings adds up and highlights next to each hotel. </li>
<li>This rating is important because we can know to take actions if a hotel has many negative ratings and to highlight top 5 hotels each week. with most number of stays.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Along with providing a safe environment for people, LikeHome will also give business owners an opportunity to get a head of their competition by simply utilizing empty rooms.</li>
<li>The Interface is equally simple for hotels, so Each time a room is reserved a script is generated and gets converted to an excel sheet using UI path. </li>
</ul>

## How I built it
<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS: For beautiful front-end and styling.</li>
<li>JavaScript, jquery: For validations and more styling. </li>
<li>UiPath: For automatically generating the script when a hotel is reserved. </li>
<li>Google Cloud: For implementing the map feature so that user can put in their location to find the closest room avaliable</li>
<li>Blockstack: For building a de-centralized application, for hotel rating system with sign-in. 
</ul>

## Challenges I ran into
Blockstack: It was our first time suing Blockstack, understanding how to build decentralized application and getting it to work was the biggest challenge.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
So proud that we were able to accomplish a working prototype of the platform which helps people to find emergency shelters.

## What I learned
<ul>
<li>Blockstack: How to build decentralized Rating app with Sign in & Storage. </li>
<li>UiPath: For Robotic process Automation for generating script and converting to excel sheet. </li>
</ul>

## What's next for likeHome
<ul>
<li>We plan to implement a fund raising platform where people can donate to those inns, hotels and motels which offer rooms for free to help people in need.</li>
 <li>We also plan to connect this platform with housing authorities so if someone needs a shelter for a longer term, they will be able to find an adequate shelter with their help.</li>
</ul>
